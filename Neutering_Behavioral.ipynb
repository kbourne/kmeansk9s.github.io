       "8   When Sherlock is being walked on leash and we come upon either a stranger or a familiar person, I am able to retain his attention upon me or have him settle quietly while the person and I talk. If, however, he is off-leash in our yard for a potty break and someone is walking on the street, whether known or unknown, he races towards them barking, and it is sometimes difficult getting him to break off and return home, especially if the person continues to walk away.  There is nothing wrong with his eyesight, as he is able quite easily to spot people walking dogs, jogging, deer in the yard, the black cat on the driveway, or squirrels in the tree.   \n",

If I am at my computer, she will take her nose and put it under my knee telling me to get up.  She will either lead me to the kitchen - look at her bowl then the fridge OR take me to the door to go out.  She is also getting up in the wee hours and will put her nose close to your head (while sleeping) and either snort or cry until you get up.  She also has become super attached and does not like me leaving her alone.  She gets depressed and mopey if I leave for too long.  I try to have someone at home with her at all times.   \n",

    "When considering the bar graph above, which displays the amount of survey respondents that reported having neutered their dogs, the fact that most repondents hail from Washington state is in line with our thinking, since the Dog Aging Project is facilitated by the University of Washington. It makes intuitive sense that most of the respondents reside within the study's home state. Another noteworthy observation is the notable presence of Californian respondents, which may not be easily explained away by the state's large population, since other highly populated states like Texas and Florida have a respondent presence several magnitudes lower. If nothing else, the fact that our dataset is highly skewed in favor of the west coast will help us make more informed geographic assertions about our analyses. "

    "The visualization above depicts the percentage of respondents by state, aggregated by gender. The primary purpose of constructing this graph was to ascertain whether or not there was any salient gender imbalances within our population, but in doing so, we have uncovered an entirely seperate issue, in the sense that none of the percentage totals for any given state add up to 100%. This indicates a general prevalence of non-responses for this particularly important field, which may imply the number of records we can truly utilize to train our predictive models is smaller than we intially anticipated, should we decide to use this field as a predictor."

    "The above age distribution of dogs included in the study is intriguing, in the sense that it's visibly skewed to the right, towards more advanced dog ages. Current consensus agrees that large dog breeds are considered senior as early as ages 6-7. medium dog breeds at ages 8-9, and smaller dog breeds at 10-12. The brunt of respondents appear to fall between ages 8 and 16, suggesting that much of our population could be considered of senior age. This observation would be important to keep in mind should we discover a diseases highly correlated with age, such as cancer, osteoarthritis, and canine dementia.

    "Upon observing the number of mislabeled points generated by the above Gaussian Naive Bayes models, I was initially tempted to laud their performance. However, outputting the classification report paints a different picture. Upon observing the precision scores for each model, it's immediately apparent that the models are exceptionally good at predicting the category 'True' and quite poor at prediciting the category 'False.' The recall scores further suggest that the models were unable to positively identify the category 'False' when presented with it. To me, these findings suggest a significant class imbalance in favor of the category 'True.' In other words, the models only really need to predict the majority class to be performant. To remedy this issue, I will attempt to oversample the minority class."

This suggests that the model is easily overfitting to the training data, a finding that is not entirely surprising given the small size of each dataframe. For future iterations of this analysis, should it be possible to acquire a dataset with more records, more complex ensemble learnig methods such as random forest may be more viable. For the purposes of our data, however, such complex models appear to produce problematic results."
